    <h2>Chicago Bulls 1984-1998 "The Michael Jordan Era"</h2>
    <p>These years for the Bulls were the best years that any team would wish for. In the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the 1984 NBA draft, the Bulls chose shooting guard Michael Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie year for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to the playoffs, where the unfortunately lost. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Later on in the 1985-1986 playoffs Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day). In the 1986–87 NBA season, Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. In the 1987 draft, to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, small forward Scottie Pippen. Pippen ended up being a great solid player for the Bulls. Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player, an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987–88 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991. In 1989–90, Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season, and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen.</p>
    <h2>First Championship Three-peat</h2>
   <p> In the 1990–91 season, the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through the playoffs, where they swept the Knicks in the first round, defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the semifinals, then eliminated defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals and won the NBA Finals in five games over the Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls won their second straight title in 1992 after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They defeated the Miami Heat in four games in the first round, the Knicks in seven hard-fought games in the second round, then the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the Eastern Conference to the Finals for the second year in a row where they defeated the Clyde Drexler-led Portland Trail Blazers in six games. In 1993, the Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks in the first three rounds and then defeating regular season MVP Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns, with John Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99–98 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

   <h2>1993–1995: Jordan's first retirement</h2>
   <p>On October 6, 1993, Michael Jordan shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his father's murder. The Bulls were then led by Scottie Pippen, who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the 1994 All-Star MVP. The Bulls opened the 1994–95 season by leaving their home of 27 years, Chicago Stadium, and moving into their current home, the United Center. When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45. He chose the No. 45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to be half as good as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, Jordan switched back to the familiar 23.</p>
   <h2>1995–1998: Second Championship Three-peat</h2>
   <p>The 1995-1996 Bulls posted one of the best single-season improvements in league history and the best single-season record at that time, moving from 47–35 to 72–10, becoming the first NBA team to win 70 or more games. Jordan won his eighth scoring title, and Rodman his fifth straight rebounding title. Jordan garnered the elusive triple crown with the NBA MVP, NBA All-Star Game MVP, and NBA Finals MVP. Both Pippen and Jordan made the All-NBA First Team, and Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman (another player on the team) made the All-Defensive First Team, making the Bulls the only team in NBA history with three players on the All-Defensive First Team.In addition, the 1995–96 team holds several other records, including the best road record in a standard 41-road-game season (33–8), the all-time best start by a team (41–3), and the best start at home (37–0). The team triumphed over the Miami Heat in the first round, the New York Knicks in the second round, the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals and finally the Seattle SuperSonics for their fourth title. The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls are widely regarded as one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball. In the 1996–97 season, the Bulls narrowly missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69–13. They repeated their home dominance, going 39–2 at the United Center. The Bulls capped the season by defeating the Bullets, Hawks and Heat in the first three rounds of the playoffs in route to winning their fifth NBA championship over the Utah Jazz. Jordan earned his second straight and ninth career scoring title, while Rodman earned his sixth straight rebounding title. In the 1997-1998 season many speculated this would be Michael Jordan's final season with the team. They made it to the playoffs. The first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the New Jersey Nets. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the Charlotte Hornets. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the Indiana Pacers. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls. The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88–83, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship. In a much anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the Utah Jazz. The Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's Delta Center. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3–1 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83–81. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams, as the Jazz had a lead late in the game. Down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone (the Utah Jazz's star) and hit the game winning shot with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87–86, the Jazz put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.</p>
